# Reducing Unsheltered Homeless Population

Code is in two R files. Maps_LA_City_Project.R file has the source code and ShinyApp.r uses that for visualizations. 

Analysis based on -

1. Density of homeless population
2. Crime based on demographics like gender, age etc. 
3. Price Analysis for building new shelters. 

Solving the problem by optimizing the combination of price, crime and unsheltered population density.
